How to run code:

1. For each ipynb file, there is a "Dataset" folder which contains the relevant datasets required to run the colab file.

2. Load all the datasets into the colab and click "Run all" directly.

3. Exception: In "Survey Analysis" -> "Q6 & Q7 Code", the source code is done in R. Ensure that the working directory is set to the "Dataset" directory before running the code.

4. The pip install code chunks for the packages required to run the code should be present in the ipynb file. In the event that it is not present, please pip install the necessary packages required.
